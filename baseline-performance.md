# Baseline Semantic Segmentation on Satellite Images

## Background

Segmentation refers to the way satellite images are depicted on a map. It involves dividing an image into different parts based on values of location, time and other factors. This process is useful for identifying geographic areas and can assist in many sectors of research and development. In this paper, we'll explain what semantic segmentation is, discuss how it's applied to satellite images and outline the technical challenges that need to be overcome when applying this technology to military applications.
First, it's important to define the term 'segmentation' as it relates to mapping. Essentially, segmentation involves dividing an image into different parts based on values of location, time and other factors. For instance, if a satellite image was segmented based on buildings, grass and trees, there would be four different segments. Each segment may be color-coded based on the value assigned to that characteristic within the image. This process is useful for identifying geographic areas; it can assist in many sectors of research and development such as agriculture, disaster management and cartography.
There are three primary types of satellite imagery: spatial, spectral and structural. Spatial imagery shows various geographic locations as well as man-made structures such as roads and buildings. spectral imagery refers to visible light frequencies such as infrared or color components, while structural imagery exposes physical attribute measurements such as land area or elevation changes. It's possible to acquire all three types of satellite imagery within a single pass but usually gathers spatial data during one pass and spectral data during another pass.
Below are the results of using the test images from satellites along with their masks and comparing that to the final image the result of 100 epochs
